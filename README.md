# How to Play

**Controls:** Move left and right with the arrow keys. Press **Space** to drop an Orb.

**Combining Orbs:** When two Orbs of the same size touch, they merge into a larger Orb. Bigger Orbs mean more points!

**Special Button:** You can click the **Bomb** button to clear an Orb for extra points. You can only use this up to **5 times**, so choose wisely.

**Game Over:** The game ends when Orbs pile past the dotted line for **both players** (you and the AI). The player with the higher score wins.
